# Computer Architecture and Logic

computers need to preform 4 different tasks
computers started out as basic calculators


1. receive information  (input)
- keyboard
- mouse
- microphone
- sensors
- network

2. store information
- uses memory or hard drive

3. process information
- preformed by the CPU

4. outpiut information
- speakers
- screen
- internet

## Binary & Data
- made up of 1's & 0's (0110010100100010101)
- each digit represents a bit
- most basic form of data
- translates to a signal of on and off
- can convert to more advanced number systems like (octal, decimal or hexidecimal)
- at higher levels binary can convery to letters, images, sounds, videos, ect.


## Circuits & Logic
- based on inputs and outputs
- there are several types of circuits such as
and, nand, not, nor, or, xor.
- they can be combined for complexity
