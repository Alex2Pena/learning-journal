1. Steps for writing a script

- Define the goal:
Think of this like a puzzle for the computer
- Design the script:
Split up the goal into a series of tasks (flow chart)
- Code each step:
Each step needs to be written in a specific code for the computer to understand

2. Expressions
- an expression evaluates to a value
- can be used to just assign a value to a variable (assigning a variable)
- they can also use 2 or more values to return a single value (math)

2. Operators
- expressions rely on operators to create a new value from an existing one
- there are several different types:
    - assignment operators
        - used in assigning value =
    - arithmitic operators
    **Multiplication & Division** are preformed before **Addition & Subtraction**. Calculations placed (inside) will be performed first.
        - (+) Addition
        - (-) Subtraction
        - (/) Division
        - (*) Multiplication
        - (++) Incriment
        - (--) Decrement
        - (%) Modulus
    - string operators
    'this is a string'
    "this is also a string"
        - join string together using a **+** symbol
    - comparison operators
    - logical operators

# Functions
*functions let you group together a group of statements to perform a specific task*

- calling a functions is when you ask it to preform its task
- a function is expected to return a value called a **return value*
- Declaring a function:
function sayHello() {
    document.write('Hello!');
}
- Calling a function:
sayHello();
